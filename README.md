# Attempts at generative watercolor

Currently just the paper. The actual watercolor will be coming soon.

To play with this, clone the repository, then install the
dependencies:

```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

To run the project with live-reloading:

```
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Big thanks to the [Webpack Frontend
Starterkit](https://github.com/wbkd/webpack-starter), which provides the
foundation of this starter.
